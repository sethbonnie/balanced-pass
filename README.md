=============

Insecure but memorable and easy to type passwords. Ideal for passwords
that are unlikely to be run against rainbows and such.

Usage
------
Requires [Python](https://www.python.org/) to be installed on your system.

Clone repo and `cd` into it. Then run the following

```sh
$ ./genpass
```

You can also just copy `genpass` to a directory on your path and run it that way.
